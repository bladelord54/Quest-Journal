## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start Small**: Don't add 100 tasks on day one. Start with 3-5 daily tasks.
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "Exercise", write "30 min run at the park"
- **Link Goals**: Connect your daily tasks to bigger goals mentally (we'll add visual linking soon!)
- **Review Weekly**: Every Sunday, plan your week
- **Celebrate Wins**: Enjoy the achievement sound - you earned it!
