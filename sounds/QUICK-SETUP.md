# 🎵 Quick Sound Setup Guide

## 🎯 NEW! Dual Format Support

**You can use WAV or MP3 - your choice!** The app automatically tries both.

## Step 1: Add Your Sound Files

Copy your sound files into this `/sounds/` folder and rename them to match these names:

**Use either .wav OR .mp3 extension:**

```
achievement-daily.wav (or .mp3)
achievement-weekly.wav (or .mp3)
achievement-monthly.wav (or .mp3)
achievement-yearly.wav (or .mp3)
achievement-life.wav (or .mp3)
notification.wav (or .mp3)
spell.wav (or .mp3)
level-up.wav (or .mp3)
quest-complete.wav (or .mp3)
boss-damage.wav (or .mp3)
boss-defeated.wav (or .mp3)
crystal-earn.wav (or .mp3)
```

## Step 2: File Format

- **WAV** - Best quality, larger files (~100KB)
- **MP3** - Smaller files (~10-50KB), good quality
- **Mix them!** - Use different formats for different sounds
- **Automatic fallback** - App tries .wav first, then .mp3
- **File size**: Keep each under 100KB for fast loading

## Step 3: Test in App

1. Open Quest Journal
2. Go to **Tools & Settings**
3. Scroll to **Sound Effects** section
4. Click **"Test Sound"** button
5. You should hear your achievement sound (whichever format you used)!

## Step 4: Adjust Settings

- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle sounds on/off
- **Volume Slider**: Adjust from 0% to 100%
- Settings are saved automatically
